## From Sketches to Screens

In school, I got bored easily. The subjects available never really sparked my interest, and even in Maths class — where you'd expect problem-solving to shine — I felt like I was memorising steps more than solving puzzles. My brain just worked differently. I thought in systems, in logic, in algorithms.

Out of that boredom, I turned to sketching in my copybooks during lessons, which is probably where my love for visual design started. Meanwhile, my spare time was filled with computer games. But even then, I wasn't just playing — I was always wondering *how* the game worked under the hood. What algorithm decided enemy behavior? How were those animations triggered?

## Growing Up in a Small Town with Big Curiosity

Growing up without much money and using an outdated laptop, problem-solving became a necessity. Fixing broken hardware or misbehaving software was a daily routine. I couldn't call someone for help, so I learned to figure it out myself. Over time, I became the neighborhood tech support kid.

Eventually, I realised fixing things wasn't enough — I wanted to build them. I wanted to be the one writing the code behind the software I used every day.

## Finding My Path in Web Development

Unfortunately, I didn't know a single person who could code. I had no roadmap, no mentors, and no clue where to start. But I *did* know I needed to see my work come to life on a screen. So, at 16, I started learning web development.

My starting point was in 2017 on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I scraped together enough money for a second-hand monitor so I could code on one screen and follow YouTube tutorials on the other. Those late nights were where everything began to click.

One of my earliest projects was a simple JavaScript calculator. I ran into a bug that took me four hours to fix. I'll never forget the feeling when I finally got it working — it felt better than any win in a game. That one bug gave me more motivation than any online course ever could. (And honestly, today's learners might miss that joy — AI debuggers make things a bit too easy.)

## Discovering UI Design

But I hit a wall: my projects worked, but they looked terrible. That frustrated me.

I always had a passion for art and aesthetics — I was the top student in my Design Communication Graphics class in secondary school — so learning UI design came naturally. Around that time, [Figma](https://figma.com) was starting to gain traction. I dived in.

I learned core design principles from YouTube and posted my designs online for feedback. After just a few months, everything changed. I started noticing design flaws *everywhere* — in websites, apps, and even street signs. And once you see them, you can't unsee them.

## Building Projects and Breaking Through

To combine what I'd learned, I started creating solo projects. One of my favorites was a fake online store I named **comp.com**. I designed the whole thing from scratch in Figma, then built it using React.js (back when class components were the norm) and pure CSS — no frameworks.

When I mentioned this to strangers on Discord, they thought I was insane for not using a CSS framework. But learning the fundamentals gave me an edge. These days, I can diagnose visual bugs faster than most front-end developers — and I owe that to grinding through tough builds.

## Opportunities Start Rolling In

As my skills matured, doors began to open:

- I started getting requests to build websites for startups and societies  
- I designed and still maintain the site for **Luna Technology Society**, a student rocketry group started by a childhood friend  
- I got hired as a part-time programming tutor in university, teaching Java and web development fundamentals  
- I was approached by a **Trinity College** research lab to develop an Irish language learning app for children — this became the subject of my [Master's dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391149095)

These projects eventually helped me land internships at **Bloomberg** and **Amazon**, where I got to apply everything I'd learned on a much larger scale.

## Looking Ahead

Now, I've graduated with a Master's in Computer Science — with Distinction. I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come from that bored student sketching in class, and I'm excited to take the next step as a full-time software engineer.

This journey has been a blend of logic, creativity, and pure stubbornness. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.
